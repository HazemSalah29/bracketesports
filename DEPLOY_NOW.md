# 🚀 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## FTP Error Fix - Manual Upload

Your GitHub Actions deployment failed because FTP secrets are not configured. Here's the immediate fix:

### ✅ READY FILES CREATED
I've created a complete deployment package in `deploy/public_html/`:
- ✅ Landing page with beautiful UI
- ✅ PHP-based API (GoDaddy compatible)
- ✅ Server configuration (.htaccess)

### 📁 UPLOAD TO GODADDY

#### Method 1: GoDaddy File Manager (Recommended)
1. **Login to GoDaddy**
   - Go to your GoDaddy account
   - My Products → Web Hosting → Manage

2. **Access File Manager**
   - Open File Manager in cPanel
   - Navigate to `public_html/` folder

3. **Upload Files**
   - Upload ALL files from `deploy/public_html/` to your `public_html/`
   - Files to upload:
     - `index.html`
     - `api/index.php`
     - `.htaccess`

#### Method 2: FTP Client (FileZilla, WinSCP)
1. **Get FTP Details from GoDaddy**
   - Server: Usually `ftp.bracketesports.com` or `bracketesports.com`
   - Username: Your cPanel username
   - Password: Your cPanel password

2. **Connect and Upload**
   - Connect to FTP
   - Navigate to `public_html/`
   - Upload contents of `deploy/public_html/`

### 🧪 TEST DEPLOYMENT

After upload, test these URLs:
1. **Main Site**: https://bracketesports.com
2. **API Health**: https://bracketesports.com/api/health
3. **API Users**: https://bracketesports.com/api/users
4. **API Tournaments**: https://bracketesports.com/api/tournaments

### 🔧 EXPECTED RESULTS

✅ **Main Site**: Beautiful BracketEsports platform with features showcase
✅ **API Health**: `{"status":"OK","message":"BracketEsports API is running",...}`
✅ **Interactive Testing**: API test buttons on the main page

### 🚨 TO FIX GITHUB ACTIONS LATER

Visit: https://github.com/HazemSalah29/bracketesports/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:
- `FTP_SERVER` - Your GoDaddy FTP server (e.g., `ftp.bracketesports.com`)
- `FTP_USERNAME` - Your cPanel username  
- `FTP_PASSWORD` - Your cPanel password
- `MONGODB_URI` - `mongodb+srv://hazemsalah:W123456789w@bracketesports-prod.6w6yjfb.mongodb.net/bracketesports?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
- `JWT_SECRET` - `your-super-secret-jwt-key-2024-production`
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - `https://bracketesports.com`

### ❓ NEED HELP?

If you can't find your FTP details:
1. Login to GoDaddy
2. Go to Web Hosting → Manage
3. Look for "FTP" or "File Manager" in cPanel
4. FTP server is usually your domain name or `ftp.yourdomain.com`
